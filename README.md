# Diabetes Prediction Web App with Streamlit

This Python project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes using the Pima diabetes dataset. The dataset was originally obtained from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The machine learning model employed for prediction is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The SVM model uses the diagnostic measurements from the Pima diabetes dataset to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes. An attempt has been made to improve the SVM model's performance by hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV. GridSearchCV exhaustively searches through a specified hyperparameter grid to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters for the SVM model.

## Dataset Information

The Pima diabetes dataset contains various diagnostic measurements such as glucose concentration, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, age, and pregnancy information of individuals. The goal is to use these features to predict whether an individual has diabetes.
